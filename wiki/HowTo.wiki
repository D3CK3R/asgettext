#summary An example of how to run asgettext for extracting translation strings

This is a short demo how to create gettext translation files for an existing Flex project.

 # {{{cd}}} to your flex source folder
{{{
cd flex_workspace/myProject
}}}
 # Initialize the translation directory
{{{
asgettext init
}}}
 if {{{asgettext}}} is not found here, either make sure it is in your [http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs541/unix_path.html PATH], or copy it directly into the flex project location.
 # Add a language to translate. "en" is installed by default.
{{{
asgettext add de
}}}
 # Extract the translation strings and update all translation files
{{{
asgettext update
}}}
 # Edit the translation files in {{{translation/locale/LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/messages.pot}}} using an editor of your choice (see [Installation] for more details)
 # Compile the translation files to mo files for distribution
{{{
asgettext compile
}}}


To use these mo files from within Flex use the [http://www.sephiroth.it/phpwiki/index.php?title=Gettext_actionscript3 Gettext classes from sephiroth].
 Now you have your compiled mo-files in {{{translation/locale/LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo}}}
