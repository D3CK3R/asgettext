For running asgettext you need the following programs installed on your machine:
  * [http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ gnu-gettext] for extracting the translation strings
  * [http://www.ruby-lang.org/ ruby] for running the script
  * A shell / terminal
  * For using gettext in Flex you need the [http://www.sephiroth.it/phpwiki/index.php?title=Gettext_actionscript3 Gettext classes from sephiroth].

Furthermore you may want to have an editor for the translation Files. A common multiplatform editor is [http://www.poedit.net/ poedit].

== Linux ==
On Linux the gettext package usually is already installed. If not, use your package manager look out for "xgettext" or "gettext" and install it.

== Mac ==
Gettext has to be installed manually. It does not ship with XCode, so you have to use [http://www.finkproject.org/ Fink] or [http://www.macports.org/ Macports].
For Macports you simply type
{{sudo port install gettext}}
in your terminal to install the gettext package.
